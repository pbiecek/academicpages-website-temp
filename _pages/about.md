## Mission

My personal mission is to enhance human capabilities by supporting them through access to data-driven and knowledge-based predictions. I execute it by developing methods and tools for responsible machine learning, trustworthy artificial intelligence and reliable software engineering.


## Academic background

I work as associate professor [MiNI@Warsaw University of Technology](http://mini.pw.edu.pl) and assistant professor [MIM@Univeristy of Warsaw](http://mimuw.edu.pl). I finished mathematical statistics at [PAM@WUST](http://wmat.pwr.edu.pl/en/) and software engineering at [CSM@WUST](http://wiz.pwr.edu.pl/en/).

More in [my CV](http://biecek.pl/CV).


## Interests

I am interested in predictive modeling of large and complex data, data visualization and model interpretability.
My main research project is [DrWhy.AI](http://drwhy.ai) - tools and methods for exploration, explanation and debugging of predictive models.
Other research activities are focused on applications, mainly high-throughput genetic profiling in oncology. 
Also I'm interested in evidence based education, evidence based medicine, general machine learning and statistical software engineering (an R enthusiast).
Big believer of [data-literacy](http://betabit.wiki).

## MI^2DataLab

I lead MI^2 group of data enthusiasts, mostly MSc and PhD students. People here are from Math and Computer Science departments from University of Warsaw or Warsaw University of Technology. Together we create tools, try new methods and look for interesting opportunities to squeeze useful information from vast amount of data.

Find out about the team, projects and initiatives at [MI2.AI](https://mi2.ai/).

## Solutions42.ai

Over the last 15 years I have carried out research and development for a number of public (University of Warsaw, Warsaw University of Technology) and private organisations (Samsung, Netezza, IBM, PositiveSolutions, Disney, iQor, LekSeek). In 2021 I founded Solutions42 to share this experience with other companies.

[Solutions42.ai](https://www.solutions42.ai/) is an agile company helping large and small partners to design, implement and deploy Responsible Artificial Intelligence solutions.

We take an individual approach to each customer. We provide trainings, develop software, validate existing models or create new ones.

If you would like to discuss a possible collaboration, feel free to contact me.


## Attitude

I am a data-driven person got it from my advisors. My PhD advisor in math was [Witold Klonecki](http://www.ibspan.waw.pl/komisja.statystyki/wspomnienia/Klonecki.pdf). His PhD advisor was [Julian Perkal](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Perkal). And his PhD advisor was [Hugo Steinhaus](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Steinhaus). And his advisor was [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert). My PhD advisor in biology was [Stanislaw Cebrat](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Cebrat).
